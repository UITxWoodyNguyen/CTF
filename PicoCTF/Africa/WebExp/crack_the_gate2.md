And it gives us the list of passwords:

### Hint
- What IP does the server think youâ€™re coming from?
- Read more about X-forwarded-For
- You can rotate fake IPs to bypass rate limits.

## Solution
- After testing some wrong password with the same source, we receive a 20-minute time-out. So for each password, we have to tried with another IP Address. Header `X-Forwarded-For` can be used to provide the source IP. We can use BurpSuite to try to login to the web with a random IP Address and a password.
- Brute Force until the flag is returned.
