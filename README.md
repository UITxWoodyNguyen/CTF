# CTF Writeups & Cybersecurity Notes

Welcome to the CTF Write-ups & Cybersecurity Notes repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge solutions, technical notes, and cybersecurity resources. It is designed as a personal knowledge base and a reference for anyone interested in cybersecurity, CTF competitions, and ethical hacking.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by CTF platforms and challenge categories:

- **18+_Notes/**: Advanced exploitation notes and deep technical dives (e.g., anti-disassembly, string format injection).
- **Dreamhack/**: Write-ups and scripts for Dreamhack CTF challenges.
- **HTB/**: Hack The Box and other CTF tryout solutions.
- **pascalCTF/**: Solutions and notes for PascalCTF, organized by crypto, pwn, and web categories.
- **picoCTF/**: Write-ups and scripts for picoCTF challenges, including cryptography, pwn, reverse engineering, and web exploitation.

Each folder contains subfolders for individual challenges, with relevant scripts, binaries, and documentation.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Web Security:** SSTI, XSS, SQLi, authentication bypass, and more.
- **Binary Exploitation:** Stack/heap overflows, format string, ROP, and memory corruption.
- **Cryptography:** Modern and classical crypto, cryptanalysis, and CTF crypto tricks.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Static/dynamic analysis, disassembly, and decompilation.
- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Shell scripting, Assembly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Browse the folders** to find write-ups, scripts, and notes for specific CTFs or topics.
2. **Read the markdown files** for detailed explanations and solutions.
3. **Use the scripts** (Python, C, etc.) to reproduce or learn from the solutions.

> **Note:** Some scripts may require specific environments or dependencies. Check the script headers or comments for details.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for new write-ups, improved solutions, or additional notes. Please ensure your content is original and properly credited.
