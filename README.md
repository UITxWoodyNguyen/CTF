# CTF Writeups & Cybersecurity Notes

**A collection of challenges, solutions, and technical notes from various CTF platforms.**

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for cybersecurity topics, documenting exploitation techniques, cryptographic methods, and reverse engineering workflows.

## 📂 Repository Contents

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`Cryptography`** | Notes on encryption algorithms, linear cryptanalysis, and mathematical attacks (e.g., Linear101). |
| **`Pwn`** | Binary exploitation write-ups, buffer overflows, and format string vulnerabilities. |
| **`Web Exp`** | Web exploitation techniques including SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) and PicoCTF solutions. |
| **`Reverse Engineering`** | Scripts and notes for analyzing compiled binaries and assembly logic. |
| **`18+_Notes`** | Advanced or "hardcore" exploitation notes (e.g., string format injection deep dives). |
| **`Picture`** | Documentation assets and raw text data related to challenges. |
